<h1>Don't Steal My Time - User Guide</h1>

<p>This application is intended to help with time organization in any kind of meeting that can be splitted into different 'turns'.</p>

<h3>The setup</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to do is define your meeting time in minutes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can define an ending time (in local hour) for the meeting, and DSMT app will calculate the remaining minutes when you press start.</p>

<p>The second step is define the amount of time slots you want your time to be divided in.</p>

<p>You can easily add the right amount of turns by entering the number and pressing accept:</p>

<p>Or you can add them one by one with the <code>add</code> button at the bottom.</p>

<p>Each turn is represented by a card, it starts empty, but you can fill it with a representative label for that specific turn:</p>

<p>Now you have all you need to start your meeting, just press <code>start</code></p>
