## Don't Steal My Time - User Guide

This application is intended to help with time organization in any kind of meeting that can be splitted into different 'turns'.

### The setup

The first thing you need to do is define your meeting time in minutes.

![set up duration in minutes](https://german969.github.com/images/user-guide/set-up-duration-minutes.png)

Alternatively, you can define an ending time (in local hour) for the meeting, and DSMT app will calculate the remaining minutes when you press start.

The second step is define the amount of time slots you want your time to be divided in.

You can easily add the right amount of turns by entering the number and pressing accept:

Or you can add them one by one with the `add` button at the bottom.

Each turn is represented by a card, it starts empty, but you can fill it with a representative label for that specific turn:

Now you have all you need to start your meeting, just press `start`
